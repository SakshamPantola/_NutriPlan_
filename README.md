## <h2>NutriPlan – AI-Powered Smart Nutrition Planner<h2>
## Problem Statement
Families often struggle to meet daily nutritional requirements due to unplanned meals and limited awareness of the nutritional value of home-cooked dishes. This leads to long-term nutritional imbalances. NutriPlan bridges this gap by transforming traditional cooking habits into a structured, data-driven nutrition strategy.

## Proposed Solution
NutriPlan is a comprehensive nutrition planning ecosystem. In this version, we have introduced a Secure Authentication System backed by a PostgreSQL Database, ensuring that every family has a private space to manage their health.

The core of the application now features an AI Planner that intelligently suggests meal combinations. By selecting familiar dishes, the system calculates nutritional gaps and generates a balanced plan. To ensure consistency, the application sends automated ingredient reminders via WhatsApp to family members, making meal preparation a collaborative effort.

## Core Features
User Accounts & Security: Mandatory signup and login to maintain personalized nutritional history and family profiles.

AI-Based Meal Planning: Smart logic that organizes selected dishes into a nutritionally balanced daily or weekly schedule.

SQLAlchemy Database: Reliable storage for user credentials, custom dish data, and historical meal logs.

Automated WhatsApp Integration: Instant ingredient alerts sent to family members to streamline grocery shopping.

Enhanced UI/UX: A refined, professional interface for seamless navigation between the dashboard and the planner.
